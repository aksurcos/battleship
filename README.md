## Features

There are many features in the codes written in this project, such as whether the placing ships fit into the area and whether the determined target location is suitable or not. However, it is not used due to unresolved errors. Since I felt inadequate after the second project and continued to learn JavaScript, I was able to devote very little time to the Python project and could not solve these problems. I'm sorry that I couldn't spare enough time to fix bugs in a project that I wanted to add so many features to.

## Bugs

### Unsolved Bugs

While there was no problem placing the ships in the beginning, when new features were added, everything became something I could not solve.

## Deployment

### Deployment steps

- Log in to your account at heroku.com if you don't have any, create one.
- Click on create a new app, give an matchless app name and then choose your region
- Click on create app
- Go to "Settings"
- Add required buildpacks. For this project, set them up as Python is on top and Node.js on bottom
- Go to "Deploy" and select "GitHub" in "Deployment method"
- Connect Heroku app to your Github account and write the repository name, click 'Search' and then 'Connect'
- Choose the branch
- If it is preferred click on "Enable Automatic Deploys" which can keep your app up to date with your GitHub repository
- Wait for the app to build. When it is ready, you will see the “App was successfully deployed” message and a 'View' button to see your deployed app.

### Inspration and Thanking
I couldn't consult Student Tutor team because I could not have enough time because of the reasons are explained above. I am aware that I need a feedback after codes checking to fix the bugs. Thanks everyone for your understanding.
